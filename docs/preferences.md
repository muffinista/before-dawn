Before Dawn has a Preferences window where you can see the list of
screensavers, and tweak your settings.

## Picking a Screensaver ##

The main tab of the preferences window lists all of the screensavers
available to you. As you click on them, you'll see a preview in the
right side of the window.

### Screensaver Options ###

Some screensavers have configurable options to control how they run --
for example, the Emoji Starfield screensaver has a control to set how
many emoji are on your screen at once. You can fiddle with these
settings and get an idea of how it looks in the preview area.

## Options ##

The Options tab of the Preferences window has a number of settings to
control how Before Dawn runs:

- *Activate after* -- you can set how long your computer is idle
before your screensaver starts
- *Disable displays after* - you can set a time that Before Dawn will
stop running and blank the screens. It's possible that your OS will do
a better job of this, but since Before Dawn is a bit of an experiment,
having this setting might save your CPU from running when your
computer is idle for a long time.
- *Lock screen after running?* -- If you want your computer to lock
once the screensaver starts running, you can use this option.
- *Disable when on batter?* -- You can toggle this so that Before Dawn
won't run if your computer is running on battery power.
- *Auto start on login?* -- should Before Dawn start automatically
  when your computer starts?

### Advanced Options ###
- *Github Repo URL*  -- Before Dawn queries a Github repository to see
  if there are any new screensavers to download. By default, it checks
  [https://github.com/muffinista/before-dawn-screensavers](https://github.com/muffinista/before-dawn-screensavers)
  but if you want to run your own custom set of screensavers, you can
  put a different Github repo here.
- *Local Source* -- If you want to develop your own screensavers, or
  run a set of screensavers that aren't on Github, you can put a path
  to a directory here. Before Dawn will check this directory for any
  local screensavers and add them to the list.
